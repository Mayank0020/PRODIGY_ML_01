# Linear Regression model for house price prediction

## Overview

This repository contains a Python notebook that demonstrates the implementation of a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on various features of the house. The model is trained on a dataset and can be used to predict house prices given new data.

## Contents

The repository contains the following file:- 

1.  task1.ipynb : A jupyter notebook including the code of the Linear Regression Model
2.  sample_submission.csv : CSV file containing the ID's and the SalesPrice of the houses
3.  test.csv : CSV file containing information about the houses

## Getting Started :-

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required python libraries from requirments.txt
3. Open the task1.ipynb on your system and run the file

## Results :-

The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²). Visualizations of the predictions vs actual values are also provided to assess the model's accuracy.

## Contributing :- 

Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas, suggestions, or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Acknoledgment :-

- The dataset was obtained from (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)
- This project was inspired by various online tutorials and courses on machine learning and data science.
